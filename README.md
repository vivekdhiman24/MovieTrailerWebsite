# Project Title
Movie Trailer project is a website built to share images or trailers of your favorite movies.  

# Getting Started
Copy the zip file of the project in your local machine and unzip the project.

# Prerequisites
Text Editor, Python 2.7.14

# Steps to install python (if not installed)

1. Navigate to the Python downloads page that indexes downloads for the most recent versions of Python.

2. Download the Windows x86 MSI installer. If you're sure that your machine runs a 64-bit version of Windows, feel free to download the Windows x86-64 MSI installer instead.

3. Once the download is finished, locate the file (it'll probably be in your Downloads directory) and run it.

4. Follow the installation wizard. Let Python install to its default directory, C:\Python27\.

5. Ensure that both pip is installed and that Python is added to your PATH.

6. To confirm that your installation was successful, open IDLE, a program installed by Python that makes it easy to edit and run Python code.

a) Windows 7 (or earlier): Use the Start Menu to go to All Programs, then Python 2.7, and, finally, IDLE (Python GUI).

b) Windows 8: Search for IDLE. Currently, you can search by swiping from the right edge of the screen or by using the lower-right corner of your screen if you have a mouse.

7. Hooray, you're done!

# Running the project (in Windows)

1. Open IDLE from the start menu.

2. Navigate to the unzipped folder in which project files are present.

5. You'll notice a new tab opens up displaying all the movie poster images.
